RELEASE CANDIDATE 0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an early release of the d13 open source engine. 

It is NOT recommended to start a full-fledged project based on d13 now, as there will
be more changes to the sourcecode in the near future. I recommend to wait until the
project matures into the first stable release version (Release Candidate 1).

INSTALL
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hosting Requirements: http web server, mysql database system (mysqli capable 5.1/5.5), php (5.6/7.0).
Before using this code make sure you have the latest versions of the above mentioned software requirements.

Installation steps:
1. create a database in mysql locally or on your webhost.
2. import the install/d13_install.sql file in the database you just created.
3. edit the database connection data in the 'd13/core/d13_config.inc.php' file;
4. rename the d13_config.inc.php file by removing CHANGEME in its name.
5. go to the install page in your browser "http://localhost/d13/install/install.php"
6. add the admin account and map data to the database;
- optionally, you can edit the map you'll be using by changing the "install/grid.png" image;
- each pixel represents one map sector;
- blue (RGB: 0 0 255) is for water, green (RGB: 0 255 0) is for land;
7. delete the "install" folder;
8. further customization is done by editing the files in the "data" folder.
9. even more customization is possible by duplicating the "default" directory in
"templates" and editing the images and template files within.

End User Requirements: Up to date browser with HTML5 / CSS3 capability.

EDITING THE GAME
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to create your own game using d13, you should ignore the sourcecode as whole
and edit the data files instead. Change all file contents to your liking before installing
the game:

1. Edit all game data files inside /data
2. Edit the language files inside /locales (new folders are added automatically to system)
3. Edit the template in /templates by duplicating the default template

New templates are added automatically and users can change their templates in the settings,
you can also change the default template in /config
