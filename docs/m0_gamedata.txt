EDITING GAMEDATA
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This chapter acts as an introduction to anyone who wants to build a strategy browser game
using the d13 engine. You will be able to modify most of the aspects that define a game,
including factions, buildings, the tech-tree as well as technologies units, resources and
components (items). There are three ways to do this, this chapter explains the easiest one.

Experts can modify the source
If you are a web-developer yourself, you can greatly expand and modify the existing d13
project by editing the sourcecode itself. This is the most complex technique that requires
a decent amount of programming knowledge spanning PHP, mySQL and handling web project in
an OOP fashion in general.

Advanced users can modify the templates
An aproach of medium complexity is to modify the templates that define the games appearance.
This requires a decent knowledge of both HTML and PHP and templating in general. In addition
you will require a program for graphic editing like GIMP or Photoshop.

Advanced users can modify the game data
This is what this chapter is all about. By editing the data within the "data" directory, you
can greatly modify how d13 works and turn it into a game of your own liking. All you need is
a text editor of your choice and at least a bit of knowledge how PHP handles arrays
(http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.array.php), thats all. It is not neccessary to
touch any of the code in the other directories or mess with the inner mechanics of the engine.
Editing the game data is all about entering numeric values and building dependencies between
objects like buildings, technologies and units. It helps to have a Excel spreadsheet or google
docs at hand to keep track of your game data there as well.
